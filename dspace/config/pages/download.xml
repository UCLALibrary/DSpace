            <p>VSim 2.0 BETA is now available for downloading and testing in both Windows and Mac versions! VSim 2.0 offers significant improvements over the prototype, and includes advanced font and text controls, scroll bars for both the Narrative and Embedded Resources Bars, more file import options, and improved filtering and editing capabilities for the embedded resources, among many new and improved features. The software is also responsive, so narrative overlays will adapt to changes in the size of the simulation window.  VSim was funded by the NEH, and the beta files were posted in December 2018. Please report any reproducible problems to <xref target="mailto:lms@idre.ucla.edu">Lisa M. Snyder</xref>.</p>
