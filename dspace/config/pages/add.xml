<head>Submitting Content to the VSim Repository and Archive</head>

<hi rend="bold">Submitting to the VSim Repository and Archive is easy.</hi>

<p>The long-term vision of the project is to build a thriving community of scholars and educators creating and sharing 3D content. To contribute to the repository and archive, users can register for a free account under the following types:</p>

<hi rend="bold">User Types</hi>
<p>
    <hi rend="italic">Unregistered User:</hi> Anyone can download VSim and content from the 
    archive without registering as a user.
</p>

<p>
    <hi rend="italic">General User:</hi> Registered General Users can upload VSim narratives, embedded resource files, and archival content to the community collections of the different 3D projects through the “Submissions” link on the main project page. If you’ve created a VSim narrative or a lesson plan for a particular project, please share!
</p>

<p>
    <hi rend="italic">Content Contributor/Creator:</hi> General users must request permission to upgrade their account to ‘Content Creator’ so that they can submit their own models and projects to the VSim Repository and Archive. Access is granted on a case-by-case basis by the Digital Library Program and the Institute for Digital Research and Education. Submission requests for models and projects will be vetted for their academic rigor and educational contribution to the community. <hi rend="bold">To request a free upgraded account, users should e-mail vsim@library.ucla.edu with your full name, institutional affiliation, a short description of the project and/or model (approximately 800 words), and a bibliography of resources that informed the construction of the model and guided the project.</hi> Requests may take up to a week to approve. 
</p>
